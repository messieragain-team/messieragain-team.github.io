      <h2>The beginning</h2>
      <p>There are several reasons why we decided to build a physical prototype, rather than a 3D model or a conceptual sketch. First, we were eager to realize a childhood passion before our eyes, no matter how rough or difficult it would be. We were also willing to learn from the process of rolling out a prototype. Last, we wanted to prove to the world that affordable, full-dome projection was possible, using a theory lacking an implementation. End result? It was worth it.</p>
      <p>Developing Starjection involved weeks of planning and dozens of online meetings. Eventually, a plan to rig a smaller mock-up dome emerged.</p>

      <h2>Dome #1</h2>
      <p>Our first dome measures 0.5 meters, or 1.6 ft. After several after-school meetings, we had a workable frame to test our projection.</p>

      <p>We learned a valuable lesson from the first prototype: small domes are not too compatible with 180° projection. While we did not end up using dome #1, the building workflow greatly reduced the time and effort that went into dome #2. And without this experience, we may not have thought to study the ideal dome size for our product.</p>

      <h2>Dome #2</h2>
      <p>From the experience of building dome #1, we decided on a dome measuring 2 meters (6.5 ft) in diameter. 2 meters was a carefully calculated design. If our dome was too small, the projector will not be able to focus, let alone use a spherical mirror properly. If it was too wide, overall brightness would have been compromised.</p>
      <p>A few week's intensive work revealed our second prototype. This time, it was a projection-worthy one.</p>

      <h2>Spherical Mirror Projection</h2>
      <p>Starjection is the first commercial product to implement spherical mirror projection. While related theory has been from proposed as early as 2003, the idea never expanded beyond a select few hobbyists at best.</p>
      <p>The essence of our system is to enable full-dome coverage without the use of special optics. This is the main culprit behind the astronomical pricing of building-grade equipment. The Messier Again team instead uses a spherical mirror to redirect light rays; this extends the projector's 50° angle to a staggering 180°.</p>

      <p>The first few days of this phase was spent aligning focus, throw, and placement. Below are some of Starjection's 'first lights.'</p>

      <h2>Starjection's present & future</h2>
      <p>At last, our team has a functioning prototype of Starjection. We are left with excitement, and yet more challenges! Our team plans on a dome build with a lighter, thinner, and sturdier wireframe than hardboard. We also plan to upgrade our projector with a shorter-throw version. Most importantly, we are eager to kickstart the first-ever planetarium content platform. An ecosystem grows slowly, but also offers a lasting advantage over potential competitors.</p>
