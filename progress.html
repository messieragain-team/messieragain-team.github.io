      <h2>The beginning</h2>
      <p>There are several reasons why we decided to build a physical prototype, rather than a 3D model or a conceptual sketch. First, we were eager to realize a childhood passion before our eyes, no matter how rough or difficult it would be. We were also willing to learn from the process of rolling out a prototype. Last, we wanted to prove to the world that affordable, full-dome projection was possible, using a theory lacking an implementation. End result? It was worth it.</p>
      <p>Developing Starjection involved weeks of planning and dozens of online meetings. Eventually, a plan to rig a smaller mock-up dome emerged.</p>

      <h2>Dome #1</h2>
      <p>Our first dome measures 0.5 meters, or 1.6 ft. After several after-school meetings, we had a workable frame to test our projection.</p>

      <p>We learned a valuable lesson from the first prototype: small domes are not too compatible with 180° projection. While we did not end up using dome #1, the building workflow greatly reduced the time and effort that went into dome #2. And without this experience, we may not have thought to study the ideal dome size for our product.</p>
