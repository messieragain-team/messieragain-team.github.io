            That's why Messier Again, from its beginning, had education as its primary goal. We reach more than enthusiasts and consumers; with a strong content ecosystem and manageable costs, Starjection will transform how students learn outside the classroom.

            <h2>Forging Starjection's journey</h2>
            <p>In the 1800s, the astronomer Charles Messier mapped dozens of nebulae, clusters and galaxies with his fragile telescope. A lot has changed since his time. <span class="hlspan"><b>The disappearance of dark skies is alarmingly dramatic</b></span>, even more so for the children of today and tomorrow.</p>
            <p>That's why the three teens of Messier Again embarked on this journey. Building a new planetarium, for a new age, for a new generation.</p>
