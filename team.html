      <h2>Behind Messier Again</h2>
      <p>All three of our team shared an abstract passion for building small things that mattered. We also had something else in common – memories of being fascinated by the planetarium as kids. When Jia Yoo came across the Conrad Challenge, we found a way to realize that idea into an innovation. The Messier Again team was born.</p>
      <p>As weeks of planning, researching, and hands-on building continued, we grew not only as better engineers but as better teammates. Building two physical prototype was a demanding task, but we emerged confident that we created a product of value, both to us and to the world.</p>
